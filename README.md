Tic-tac-toe:
  Humans and other animals engage in many activities that aren't directly essential to life (those would be work), but are pursued for the sheer joy that comes from facing, and possibly overcoming, a challenge: moving a ball across a field, moving your body and a skipping rope around each other, finding the word that fits in a crossword, or tweaking a Python program. Some of these recreational activities have enough structure to be identified as games. Computers can be programmed to play some games, with varying degrees of success. Some reasons for teaching computers to play games are: 
•	It's useful, for example, for training human players
•	Programming a computer to play helps us understand the game better.
•	Programming a computer to play helps us to understand things, other than games, that computers can potentially do.
•	Programming a computer to play hard games can be challenging, interesting, and fun for its own sake. Some game-playing strategies for computers are completely solved, others aren't.
